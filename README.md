# Picture In Picture

This is an app that will allow you to open any screen, application, or tab in a movable, resizable, window that will stay on top of anything you do. So you can have a tutorial video in the corner of your screen while you are working on something in the background !
<br/>
It uses the Picture-in-Picture API ans Screen Capture API.
